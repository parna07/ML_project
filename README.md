This project analyzes YouTube comments using NLP and machine learning to understand tourist sentiments about lesser-known travel destinations.
Collected approximately 200,000 YouTube comments related to offbeat travel spots.
Preprocessed using tokenization, normalization, stopword removal, etc.

Algorithm Used:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
